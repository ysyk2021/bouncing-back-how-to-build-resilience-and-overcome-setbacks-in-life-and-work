Cultivating flexibility and agility is important for adapting to change in the workplace. This may involve developing a willingness to try new approaches, being open to feedback and criticism, and continually updating skills and knowledge to stay relevant and adaptable.

Building Resilience Through Self-Care

Seeking out opportunities for learning and development can help individuals develop the skills and knowledge needed to adapt to change and succeed in the face of uncertainty.
